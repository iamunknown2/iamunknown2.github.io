			<h1>The problem with the Scratch community</h1>
			<p>For the people not in the know, Scratch is a platform where its "Scratchers" can share "projects", which are all written in the graphical, block-based Scratch programming language. Although Scratch's motto is <b>"Imagine, Program, Share"</b>, there has been a growing amount of Scratchers using Scratch for other purposes...</p>
			<p>The first issue I'm going to discuss in this blog post will be the "F4F" trend, which is short for "follow for follow". As the name suggests, the F4F trend involves 2 people following each other <b>for no reason</b>. They're not following because they're friends, they're not following each other because they like each other's projects - instead, they're doing it for the sake of attempting to increase the amount of followers they have/amount of Scratchers they're following. Although the F4F situation isn't a big deal, it does get irritating when they start demanding you for a follow, threatening to unfollow if they don't do so, along with the fact that this doesn't fulfill any part of the motto of Scratch (Imagine, Program, Share).</p>
			<p>The second issue are the "follow-everyone" accounts that are gradually increasing in amount. Unlike F4Fs, the main goal of these accounts is to follow as many people as possible. Although this may not seem like a big deal at first, there was once a bot that followed so many people that it nearly crashed the Scratch servers! Although these accounts (individually) may not be able to follow tens of thousands of people, the rise of "follow-everyone" accounts can gradually increase the amount of junk stored on the Scratch servers. These accounts are also a even worse violation of the Scratch motto of "Imagine, Program, Share", as the accounts don't bother to put thought in the projects if they make any.</p>
			<p>The final issue with the community I will discuss the problem of project copies - instead of creating an original project, maybe even borrowing a few resources here and there from fellow Scratchers, they simply get an existing one - usually a popular one - before copying it and passing it off as their own. Although this is obvious a violation of the Community Guidelines (an abridged Terms of Service for the community), the usual project-copiers are young people who don't understand the problem with project copying. Unfortunately, there are people who continue seeking for "fame" via project copying, even after they learn that it is a violation of the community guidelines.</p>
			<h3>OK, but how do we fix these problems?</h3>
			<p>Although I do mildly agree with adding a community guideline regarding following the Scratch motto, I believe that there is a less drastic solution to this problem - perhaps we should raise awareness of the fact the Scratch was meant as a platform for sharing original projects.</p>
			<p>The Scratch Team has taken action via making the follower/project/following count more obscure.</p>
			<h3>Why would that work?</h3>
			<p>Paddle2See explains it nicely:</p>
			<blockquote>I think it's a universal rule that if there is a number associated with something, somebody will try and maximize it.  Thus, we end up with people trying to get the most projects in a studio, the most studios in an account, etc.  We have taken some actions in the past to try to demotivate this kind of activity by making some of the numbers less obvious or removing them entirely (forum post count, number of projects in a studio, number of followers, etc.)</blockquote>
