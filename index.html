			<h2><b>GitPak!</b></h2>
			<p>GitPak is the easier way to upload to your GitHub repository or add a page to your GitHub website!</p>

			<h2>A Prime Number Generator?</h2>
			<p>I was a bit bored while I was at school, so I cooked up a program that will specify the nth prime (after putting in the value of 'n', of course!)</p>
			<p>You can download the programs and source (and README) <a href="./programs/Nth_Prime.zip" download="">here</a></p>
			<button onclick="getprime()">Click me to try out the JS prime number generator!</button>
			<script src="./programs/Nth_Prime.js"></script>
			<h3>List of changes (previous changes in bold):</h3>	
			<li><b>Should be at least <s>2x faster much faster (will stop checking when the prime is larger than (approx.) the square root of the test subject)</s> now accelerated it a bit by not requiring floats!</li>
			<li><s>Changed decision clauses (e.g if, elif etc.)</s> They broke stuff - Removed.</li>
			<li>Changed "if" statements - Tested and speeds up program a bit!</li>
			<li>Changed the way the final answer is shown, and with less lines!</li>
			<li>Now with native Linux program and C file (yes, I rewrote it in C BY HAND) in zip file with README!</li>
			<li>Now with a new SPEEDY version (for C program); only prints result! Of course, you still have the normal version of the program</li>
			<li>The C program was broken, replaced with a method that relies more on brute-force.</li>
			<li>Now, the way the answer is displayed should be a bit neater (for C program, both versions)...</b></li>
			<li>Speed for C programs should improve a bit...</li>
			<li>C programs should technically double by speed...</li>

			<h2>Hashing a key?</h2>
			<h3>NOTE: THIS WAS DESIGNED BY A TEEN WITH SPARE TIME. DO NOT USE THIS FOR ACTUAL CRYPTOGRAPHIC PURPOSES.</h3>
			<p>When I was bored during the summer holiday, I wrote up a quick hashing and cracking program in Python, which uses the one way function also used for the D-H key exchange algorithm.</p>
			<p>You can download the program <a href="./programs/keyhasher.zip">here</a></p>

			<h2>Enigma Remake</h2>
			<p>In the Christmas holidays, I created a encryption program based on the Enigma machine. Instead of 4 rotors, this machine uses 12 rotors, making the key space to roughly 2<sup>85</sup>.</p>
