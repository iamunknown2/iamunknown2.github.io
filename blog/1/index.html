			<h1>An introduction to Javascript</h1>
			<p>If you're reading this, you're probably trying to learn how to program. Despite what some teachers will tell you, learning Pascal/Fortran/any language you've never heard of is <i>not</i> the way to learn programming nowadays, as Pascal was made between 1968 and 1969 - Yep, it was made when the military was the only group that had any access to ARPANET (the predecessor of the Internet)!</p>
			<p>Nowadays, it's different. The web has its own industry (e.g Google). Guess what the programming language of the web is? HTML and CSS? Despite what you may believe, HTML and CSS isn't actually a programming language - HTML is just for displaying content, while CSS is to make the content prettier. Instead, the programming (or I should say <b>scripting</b>) language of the web is <b>Javascript</b>.</p>
			<p>As the title suggests, I'm going to teach you a bit of JavaScript. Let's start with the basics...</p>
			<h2>Before we begin...</h2>
			<p>Hold Ctrl+Shift+I (as in eye) and see what pops up. To make sure you can follow my further instructions, hit	the button on the left of the "x" button if you see something popping out from the right. Now, you should see a window at the bottom of your screen. Finally, click on the "Console" tab of the window.</p>
