			<h1>An Introduction to JavaScript - Part 1</h1>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>If you're reading this, you're probably trying to learn how to program. Despite what some teachers will tell you, learning Pascal/Fortran/any language you've never heard of is <i>not</i> the way to learn programming nowadays, as Pascal was made between 1968 and 1969 - Yep, it was made when the military was the only group that had any access to ARPANET (the predecessor of the Internet)!</p>
			<p>Nowadays, it's different. The web has its own industry (e.g Google). Guess what the programming language of the web is? HTML and CSS? Despite what you may believe, HTML and CSS isn't actually a programming language - HTML is just for displaying content, while CSS is to make the content prettier. Instead, the programming (or I should say <b>scripting</b>) language of the web is <b>JavaScript</b>.</p>
			<p>As the title suggests, I'm going to teach you a bit of JavaScript. Let's start with the basics...</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Before we begin...</h2>
			<p>Hold Ctrl+Shift+I (as in eye) and see what pops up. To make sure you can follow my further instructions, hit	the button on the left of the "x" button if you see something popping out from the right. Now, you should see a window at the bottom of your screen. Finally, click on the "Console" tab of the window.</p>

			<p>Let's get started!</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Alerting, logging, errors and all that stuff</h2>
			<p>For a start, see what happens when you type this into the console (that you presumably have open) before hitting Enter:</p>
			<code>console.log("Hello world");</code>
			<h3>Wow! How does that work?</h3>
			<p>To explain how this works completely would require us to have a more advanced understanding of JS which will be unveiled later in this course. However, the best way to put it is that <b>console.log()</b> is a <i>function</i> (a command) that will print (aka <i>log</i> anything between the brackets (the thing between the brackets is also known as a <i>parameter</i>) to the console.</p>
			<h3>What about those pop-up boxes? Can you make them in JavaScript?</h3>
			<p>Yes. In fact, you're <i>supposed</i> to make those pop-up boxes in JavaScript! Type this into the console before you hit Enter:
			</p>
			<code>alert("Hello world");</code>
			<p>As you can see, <b>alert()</b> is a <i>function</i> that outputs the parameters to the console.</p>
			<h3>I was talking about the kind of pop-up box that has 2 options!</h3>
			<p>Fine. It's</p>
			<code>confirm("This is a confirm message.")</code>
			<p>And while you're at it, see what this does:</p>
			<code>prompt("Input something:", "Place input here")</code>
			<p>But in order to make the confirm/prompt boxes <i>interactive</i>, it'll require us to have at least a basic understanding of variables/arrays etc, which I will cover in the next post.</p>
			<h2>Summary for part 1</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><b>console.log</b> outputs its <i>parameter</i> to the JavaScript console</li>
				<li><b>alert</b> (or <b>window.alert</b>) will output its parameter to a pop-up box.</li>
				<li><b>confirm</b> (or <b>window.confirm</b>) will output its parameter to a pop-up box <i>with 2 options</i>: OK/Cancel.</li>
				<li><b>prompt</b> (or <b>window.prompt</b>) will output its first parameter to the message in a pop-up box, and will output its second parameter to the message inside the input box, which in turn is inside the pop-up box.
			</ul>
