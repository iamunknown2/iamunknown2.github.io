#Science revision notes

##Energy

####Energy can't be created or taken away.
* However, it is possible for the density of energy to be so low that it is not usable anymore (will explain later)
* It is also possible to change the form of energy

####Energy transfers are more common than you think:

* You punching another guy in the head counts as an energy tranfer: The **kinetic energy** your fist used to have was transferred to the head of the guy.
* Another example of energy transfer is riding a bike: The energy exerted by the pedaling leg is transferred to the bike, which through a set of mechanical parts transfers the energy to the back wheel.

####The spreading out of energy isn't as scary as you think:
Let's say that there's a red hot piece of metal in the room. However, it eventually cools...
* The heat energy wasn't lost completely
* The heat energy wasn't lost mostly via conversion to other forms of energy, leaving one possibility:
* The heat energy slowly spread out across the room, evening out the heat

As another example, let's say you're playing with a snooker table, fully set up. You use the snooker stick to hit the first ball in the triangle. Do the rest of the balls:
1. Not move?
2. Move altogether, although moving slower, compared to the speed of one ball being hit?
3. Move altogether, at the same speed of one ball being hit.
* The answer is 2 - although all the balls are affected, the kinetic energy is spread out among the balls, and has less energy per ball, when compared to hitting one ball **alone**.


##Mass and gravity

####What's the difference between mass and weight?

Mass is the amount of an object (and should be measured in e.g kg), while weight is the measure of the force of gravity acting down on the object.

####What are the factors that affect the strength of gravity?

* The mass of object 1
* The mass of object 2
* The distance between object 1 and object 2

####How would you prove that light objects fall as fast as heavy objects?

#####You will need:

* 2 geometrically similar objects with the same shape, but with different sizes
* An even floor

#####Instructions:

1. From the same height, drop both of the objects at the same time.
2. Record which one hit the ground first, or if they hit the ground at the same time (more or less).
3. Repeat experiment.

##The Solar System

####Most solar system diagrams are **not to scale**.

[Here's](http://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html) a more accurate diagram, with the moon being one pixel. See how big the sun is compared to the Solar System's biggest planet, Jupiter?

####Planets

* The planets are named after Roman gods.
* Mercury **isn't** the hottest planet, despite being closest to the Sun. Surprisingly enough, its neighbor **Venus** is.
* Venus spins in the opposite direction of the other planets in the Solar System.
* Earth is the only planet known to sustain life.
* Mars's red color comes from its abundance of iron oxide, and stores quite a lot of ice (yes - **water**.)
* Mars and Jupiter is separated by the **asteroid belt**.
* Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System, despite being much smaller than the sun.
* Saturn is well known for its (visible) horizontal rings, although Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune have them as well.

##The EM spectrum

* The **electromagnetic spectrum**, also known as the EM spectrum, is a spectrum of EM waves (colors, ultraviolet, infrared etc).
* Here's a quick diagram of the EM spectrum (ordered):

####EM Spectrum in Astronomy

Astronomers use the whole EM spectrum to observe stars, as celestial bodies emit EM waves of different energies - they've radiated gamma rays and radio waves!

##Beliefs

Previously, the Solar System had a **geocentric** model - everything was believed to revolve around the earth. However, most people accept a slightly decentralized **heliocentric** model - the sun is the center of the **Solar System** only, and not the center of the universe.

The reason why the radical (at the time) re-thinking of the Solar System was rejected was because of **faith**. Unfortunately, the Church at the time believed that God placed them in the center of the universe, as doctrine suggested that were very important in the eyes of God. However, they had an unofficial Inquisition group that tortured/executed people with "heretical" beliefs, or people who were "witches".

However, nowadays, scientists use our current model - instead of just hypothesizing on what would happen, they actually **carry out experiments**, and use the results to reach  a conclusion. The reason why scientists accept this model is because most things fall into patterns - most experiments are for detecting those patterns, and the conclusion is simply the pattern that was observed during the experiment. However, the current scientific method may not be accurate enough, as some things **don't** fall into a pattern. The scientists may over-predict the pattern, and get things wrong. On the other hand, the scientific method is also about replacing old theories with new ones. There is also a rather peculiar **"evolution of knowledge** pattern I would like to show you:

1. Aristotle thinks to reach conclusions - he thinks about "perfection" and "the 5 elements".
2. Galileo tests Aristotle's accepted facts of gravity, they're wrong
3. Newton does plenty of tests, e.g disproving ether.
4. Einstein uses "thought-experiments" - he forms experiments in his mind, and records what he **thinks** would happen. Although some may argue that he is not following the **scientific method**, some may also argue that his "thought-experiments" were a way for him to form some **very** reasonable hypotheses, as he once ran a real experiment and (sort of) disproved Isaac Newton!

##Forces

####Balanced VS unbalanced forces

**Balanced** forces are forces that cancel each other out - in other terms, the net force of **balanced** forces are **0**. Example: 2 people with equal strength playing tug of war - as the forces of either side are equal, the rope goes nowhere - the 2 forces cancel each other out, allowing physicists to describe the 2 forces as **balanced** forces.

On the other hand, **unbalanced** forces are when one force is stronger than the opposing force. Example: 2 people, one strong, one relatively weak, play tug of war. The rope goes **towards** the person who's stronger. As the 2 forces **don't** cancel out, physicists can describe these 2 forces as **unbalanced** forces.

####Resultant forces

Resultant forces are known as **net forces**, as they are essentially the sum of all the forces acting on a particular object. However, some of the force will be cancelled out (see "**balanced forces**" above. The resultant force on an object **will** cause a change in velocity - if it cancels out some of the force, it slows it down, changing its velocity. If it "overpowers" the opposing force, it will start moving in the opposite direction, which also counts as changing its velocity.

Also, the gradual change of velocity over time is also known as **acceleration**.

##Pressure

####Formula for pressure

As pressure is measured in force/area, the formula for pressure is simply force/area. Example: If the force is 10N and the area is 10cm^2, the amount of pressure is 

10N/10cm^2
= **N/cm^2**

####Use of pressure in the real world

The most obvious application of pressure in the real world would be **pressure cookers**...

The pressure cooker, as the name suggests, uses **pressure** to cook things faster - the pressure forces steam (which is 100+ celsius, as it's turned into water vapor) to transfer part of its heat to the food inside the pressure cooker, accelerating the process.

####Why is there pressure in fluids (liquids **and** gases)?

####Liquids:

**Water pressure** is the most obvious example. Like all fluid pressure, water pressure is the same in all directions.

####Gases:

**Air pressure** is the most obvious example. Like other forms of fluid pressure, air pressure is the same in all directions. Here's a demonstration to prove that:

1. Get a balloon and fill it up with air.
2. Heat it up ![BANG](https://whoisscout.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/explodedwaterballoon.png)

That was simple, wasn't it?

However, why doesn't the air contract? Why does the balloon expand instead?

I'll explain:

1. When you heat up the balloon, you heat up the air particles inside it.
2. When the air particles are "hot", they are much more active, and run around much more
3. The air particles crash into the sides (of all directions) more, increasing the net force on the balloon, causing the balloon to stretch more and more, until **BANG**!

##Pressure and depth

Pressure also increases with increasing depth of fluids; assuming the object inside/below the fluid doesn't change, let's look at the formula for pressure again:

**Pressure = Force / Area**

The more deep you are into the fluid, the more fluid that is on top of you. As the area of the object exposed to the pressure never changes, the pressure is greater, as the force increases.

##Pressure in real life

Other than the **pressure cooker** we've seen in these notes, there's also a rather infamous sickness related to pressure, known as **decompression sickness**. Here's how it happens:

1. A person takes in compresseed air
2. As the person takes in compressed air, more gases than usual dissolve in the blood.
3. If the person leaves the pressuer too quickly, the gases don't have time to clear out, and form bubbles in **blood vessels**. Yikes!

Unfortunately, these bubbles are more harmful than you think - they can cause **pain**, **permanent injury** and maybe even **death**!
